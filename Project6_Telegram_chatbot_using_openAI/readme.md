A lightweight, effective Telegram bot that leverages OpenAI (e.g. GPT‑3.5, GPT‑4) for generating intelligent conversational responses based on user inputs.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

```text
User → Telegram (Front-End) → Backend (calls OpenAI API) → LLM → Response → Backend → Telegram → User


**Flow Description**:
1. **User** sends a message to the Telegram bot.
2. **Telegram** forwards the message to your **backend server**.
3. The backend sends the prompt to **OpenAI's API**.
4. LLM generates a response (GPT‑3.5 / GPT‑4).
5. Backend relays the reply back to **Telegram**, which displays it to the user.

*(A visual diagram is included in the repo to illustrate this flow.)*
